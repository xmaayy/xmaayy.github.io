Sometimes you have good ideas. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you wish you had good ideas, but for no reason other than your brain is permanently on pause you may never get struck with that lightning bolt of inspiration. I've been in that state for the better part of 5 years, watching others use their worldly knowledge to come up with things so creative, you wonder if they're really more artist than engineer. Its because of this I decided to join a small team of friends on a project that I think is, if not artistically creative, rather interesting.

I'm going to use this blog as a place to host my process for developing it. Meetings, development hardships, user studies, etc. My hope is that this is never found until such a time as the app has been minorly successful, or at the very least, somewhat complete. I hate getting into a show when I'm still going to have to wait for the season to complete.

The main function and idea behind the app will be kept a secret, and development strategies anonymized enough that they cant easily be pieced together into a whole until the app is released.

Stay tuned.
